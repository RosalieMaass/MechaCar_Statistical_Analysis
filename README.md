## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- This linear regression showed us that vehicle length and ground clearance had the most significant impact on mpg and provide non-random variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
- The slope of the linear model is not zero.
- We can also tell thislinear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectivly because the multiple R-squared is .7149 or about 71%.
